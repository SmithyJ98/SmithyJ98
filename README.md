# About me


- ðŸ”­ I've just finished up my 16 week School of Code bootcamp and I am now trying to get into employment.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building a portfolio website to host all of my projects in one place.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I accidentally got mixed up in my initial setup and called my repository a "suppository" which got a good laugh when I was called out for it ðŸ¤£
