# About me


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my precourse work for School of Code in order to get achieve the baseline knowledge before getting stuck in. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of git, HTML, CSS, Javascript
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I accidentally got mixed up in my initial setup and called my repository a "suppository" which got a good laugh when I was called out for it ðŸ¤£
